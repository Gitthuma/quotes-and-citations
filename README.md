Active learning: Who said that?

Time for another active learning example! In this example we'd like you to:

-Turn the middle paragraph into a blockquote, which includes a cite attribute.

-Turn "The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk" in the third paragraph into an inline quote, and include a cite attribute.

-Wrap the title of each source in <cite> tags and turn each one into a link to that source.

The citation sources you need are:

http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html for the Confucius quote
http://www.affirmationsforpositivethinking.com for "The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk".
